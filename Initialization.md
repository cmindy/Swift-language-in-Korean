# Initialization

*Initialization* is the process of preparing an instance of a class, structure, or enumeration for use. This process involves setting an initial value for each stored property on that instance and performing any other setup or initialization that is required before the new instance is ready for use.

You implement this initialization process by defining *initializers*, which are like special methods that can be called to create a new instance of a particular type. Unlike Objective-C initializers, Swift initializers do not return a value. Their primary role is to ensure that new instances of a type are correctly initialized before they are used for the first time.

Instances of class types can also implement a *deinitializer*, which performs any custom cleanup just before an instance of that class is deallocated. For more information about deinitializers, see [Deinitialization](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Deinitialization.html).

## Setting Initial Values for Stored Properties

Classes and structures *must* set all of their stored properties to an appropriate initial value by the time an instance of that class or structure is created. Stored properties cannot be left in an indeterminate state.

You can set an initial value for a stored property within an initializer, or by assigning a default property value as part of the propertyâ€™s definition. These actions are described in the following sections.

NOTE

When you assign a default value to a stored property, or set its initial value within an initializer, the value of that property is set directly, without calling any property observers.
